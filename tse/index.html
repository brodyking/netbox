            <h3>Installing</h3>
            Please use the <a href="https://github.com/brodyking/netbox-packages/">netbox-packages</a> package manager to install TSE as it is the easiest way. We will need 2 packages to get this to work<br><br>
            <pre>root@netbox $ pmi tseport

</pre>    
<pre>root@netbox $ pmi tsethemes
====================================

            <h3>Usage</h3>
            Just use it as if you were using ef, but type tse instead!<br>
            <br>
<pre>root@netbox $ tse hello
TSE was opened in a new window.</pre>
            <h3>The Advantages of TSE</h3>
            Kedit and TSE are very different in how they render the text. The built in tools render HTML inside the document.
            Say you tried to edit nmConfig, well it would not work because it would render the elements.
            TSE dosent render them, it just writes out them as text, allowing you to edit it.<br>
