            <h2>Brew</h2>
            Brew is a web browser that we talked about in <a href="../installing-apps/">Installing Apps</a>. But this page will give a more in-depth tutorial on how to use it.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>Installing</h3>
            Please use the <a href="https://github.com/brodyking/netbox-packages/">netbox-packages</a> package manager to install brew as it is the easiest way.<br><br>
            <pre>root@netbox $ pmi brew
====================================
Your package is finished installing!
====================================</pre>    
            <h3>Usage</h3>
            Using brew is very simple. Type in brew + any website url to view that website.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="usage.png"><img src="usage.png"></a><br>
            <br>
            The config button brings you to a empty screen. This is because there are still no settings to modify in the latest version of brew.
            The goto button lets you change what site you are currently viewing.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>Known Issues</h3>
            There are a few known bugs that are probably never going to be fixed. Here is a list.
            <ol>
                <li>URL in the middle not updating</li>
                <li>Brew window number not going down when other windows have been closed</li>
            </ol>
            While yes, these could be fixed it is not really worth it so I am not going to fix it.
