            <h2>Desktop Environments</h2>
            A Desktop Environment is typically the GUI part of a operating system. Think of how linux has different DE's like Gnome, Xfce, and i3.
            Netbox has a few of its own. They are all free and open source for you to use. Here is a list of all of them (with pictures!)<br>
            <br>
            <h3>#1 TypeSet (ts)</h3>
            TypeSet was made for the customization freaks. It also has custom utilites built in!<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>#2 Nbwm</h3>
            Nbwm is the default Window Manager that was created by the developers. All other DE's are based on it.<br>

            <br>
            <h3>#3 Iwm</h3>
            A modified version of Nbwm that has a clock and smaller window bar.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>#4 Powerline</h3>
            The origion of TypeSet with a powerline bar.<br>

            <h2>How to install a DE</h2>
            Goto the <a href="../downloads/">downloads</a> page and grab the specific DE you want. Unzip and drag the files into the folder that contains <code>kernal.js</code>.
            Then open the <code>index.html</code> file and you are ready to start learning how to use NetBox!
